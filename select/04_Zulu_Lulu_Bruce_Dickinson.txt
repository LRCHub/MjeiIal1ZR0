She fixed me in the corner with that beautiful brown eye
She says, I'd like to meet you
I was so surprised
Well what can I do for you?
What can you do for me?
We made for the exit, had to wait and see
I hope I'm not wasting your precious time
I know you're not wasting mine
We came together over coffee with milk
She never stopped 'till every drop was spilt

She was a Zulu Lulu
Broke my back and my heart at the same time, honey, well
Just a Zulu Lulu
I had to move on, when I came back she'd gone, gone, gone

She dropped to her knees, I guess she had religion
She lived with her mother, had been a good girl twice
When I asked her to comment on her present position
She said she liked to take a lay preacher's advice
I ain't looking for sympathy
But prayers for the wicked are kinda nice
She said, I don't like to preach to the converted
I said, you can be a good girl more than twice, like this

She was a Zulu Lulu
Broke my back and my heart at the same time, it was nice
Just a Zulu Lulu
I had to move on, when I came back she'd gone, gone, gone,
Gone, gone, gone, gone away somewhere

I ain't looking for sympathy, oh no
But prayers for the wicked are always nice
She looked me up and down and said
Assegai for me
I began to see God she said, wait and see babe
Wait and see babe, wait and see babe
Wait, wait, oh, gonna'

She was a Zulu Lulu
Broke my back and my heart at the same time, it was nice
She was a Zulu Lulu
Had to move on, when I came back she'd gone, gone

She was a Zulu Lulu
She broke my back and my heart at the same time, honey, well
Just a Zulu Lulu
Had to move on, when I came back she'd gone, gone, gone,
Gone, gone, gone
